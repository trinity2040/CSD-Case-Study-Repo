☕ Java: The main programming language used to build the application.

🔗 JDBC (Java Database Connectivity): For connecting and executing queries on the MySQL database.

🗃️ MySQL: The relational database management system used to store data and manipulate database tables.

**Database Schema**

Before running the application, create the necessary database tables in MySQL using the following SQL commands:

1️⃣ Database Creation

First, create a database named car_rental_db:

CREATE DATABASE car_rental_db;

USE car_rental_db;

2️⃣ Customers Table

Create a table to store customer details:

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
);

3️⃣ Cars Table

Create a table to store car details:

CREATE TABLE Car (
    car_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    make VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    model VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    year INT NOT NULL,
    daily_rate DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

4️⃣ Rentals Table

Create a table to store rental records:

CREATE TABLE Rental (
    rental_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    car_id INT NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    rental_start_date DATE NOT NULL,
    rental_end_date DATE NOT NULL,
    total_charges DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (car_id) REFERENCES Car(car_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id)
);
